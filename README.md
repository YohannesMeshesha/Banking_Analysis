In today's competitive business world, customer churn is a significant challenge that most companies face, including banks. Losing customers can have a significant impact on the bank's bottom line, and it is crucial to identify the reasons behind customer churn to develop strategies to retain them.

To address this issue, I have developed a Power BI report that provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for banks. The report includes various charts and slicers that allow for interactive and granular analysis of the data. Let's take a closer look at some of the key features of the report.

The report provides an overview of the total number of customers, active customers, inactive users, credit card holders, non-credit card holders, exit customers, and retained customers in the selected location and category. This information gives an idea of the customer churn rate and retention rate, which is critical for banks to understand.

The report also includes interactive slicers that enable filtering of the data by year, month, location, active category, exit category, and gender category. This functionality allows for a more granular analysis of customer churn based on the user's preferences.

In addition, there are charts that show the number of exit customers by gender category and by their specific category. This information can help banks identify the categories of customers who are most likely to exit the bank and take proactive measures to retain them.

The report also features a line chart that displays the trend of exit customers and the previous month's exit customers in the selected location and category. This chart can help banks analyze whether the customer churn rate is increasing or decreasing over time.

Lastly, there is a clustered column chart that shows the total number of customers and the number of active customers for each year in the selected location and category. This chart provides insights into the growth of the customer base and the trend of active customers over time.

In conclusion, the Power BI report I have developed provides valuable insights into customer churn for banks. By analyzing the data using the various charts and slicers, banks can identify the factors that influence customer churn and develop strategies to retain their customers. With this information, banks can build loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible and remain competitive in the industry.
